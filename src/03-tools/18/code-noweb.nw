Our basic C program consists of the five parts:
<<*>>=
<<Header files to include>>
<<Type definitions>>
<<Global variables>>
<<Function definitions>>
<<The main program>>
@

As we intend to present information to the user, 
we should include the standard I/O library.
<<Header files to include>>=
#include <stdio.h>
@

So it goes.
